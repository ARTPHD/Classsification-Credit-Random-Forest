# Classsification-Credit-Random-Forest
# Credit Classification Using Random Forest Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements a credit classification model using the Random Forest algorithm, specifically designed for evaluating creditworthiness based on the 5C's of credit: Character, Capacity, Capital, Collateral, and Conditions. The model aims to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

## Introduction

Credit classification is crucial for lenders to assess the risk associated with potential borrowers. This project utilizes the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning technique, to classify applicants based on various features derived from the 5C's of credit.

## 5C's of Credit

1. **Character**: Borrower's reputation and credit history.
2. **Capacity**: Borrower's ability to repay the loan based on income and expenses.
3. **Capital**: Borrower's own investment in the project.
4. **Collateral**: Assets pledged by the borrower to secure the loan.
5. **Conditions**: Economic and environmental factors that may affect repayment.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project includes:

- **Applicant Information**: Age, employment status, income, etc.
- **Loan Details**: Amount, purpose, term, etc.
- **5C's Features**: Derived scores or qualitative assessments based on the 5C's.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd credit-classification
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the model, execute the following command:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

To evaluate the model, run:

```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

Make sure to adjust parameters in the scripts as necessary.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC

These metrics provide insight into the model's effectiveness in classifying credit applicants.

## Results

The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the validation set. Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the `results` directory.
